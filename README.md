# Facial-features
A case study on transfer learning - CNN models

In this below project, we use the DeepFace API for Age, Gender, Expression Facial and Recognition. We even use the headpose library to obtain head direction/tilt. DeepFace is an easy to use python module that provides access to several Facial Detection and Recognition models. It's very simple to use to let's dive in.
